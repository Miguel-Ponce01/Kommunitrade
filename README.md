# USER MANUAL: HOW TO USE KOMUNITRADE

### 1. AI-Powered Hyperlocal Posting
- Click **"Post Item"** on the navigation bar.
- Upload a product photo.
- **Smart Category & Metadata Layer**: The **Roboflow Workflow** (`detect-and-classify`) runs in parallel with **Google Cloud Vision OCR**. 
  - If Roboflow returns category confidence **>= 0.65**, we trust the Roboflow category.
  - If confidence is low, the pipeline falls back to the **DeepSeek/Gemini** LLM category.
  - Google Cloud Vision extracts the text to auto-populate the title, description, tags, suggested price, and food expiry days (if classified as food).
- Click **"Publish"** to list your item.

### 2. E2EE Negotiation & Deal Finalization
- View an item and click **"Chat with Seller"**. Your messages are fully **End-to-End Encrypted (ECDH P-256 + AES-GCM)**.
- Once you negotiate a deal, click **"Finalize Agreement"** to propose meetup details. The system automatically calculates the mid-point between buyer and seller and suggests **safe meetup hotspots** near your center.
- The partner can Accept (which locks the listing and sets `isSold: true`) or Decline.

### 3. Double PIN Handshake Meetup
- Once confirmed, the receipt displays your unique **Verification PIN**.
- During the physical meetup, exchange and input each other's PINs to complete the trade. Success grants a permanent `+5` points to both users' trust scores.

### 4. Deal Cancellation Protocol
- If you need to cancel a confirmed agreement before meeting, open the Transaction Receipt and click **"Cancel Confirmed Deal"**.
- Select a cancellation reason and describe the details.
- **System Impact**:
  - The transaction status changes to `'Cancelled'`.
  - The listing is automatically restored (`isSold: false`) and goes back to the active marketplace.
  - A penalty of **-5 trust points** is deducted from your score to prevent spam cancellations.
  - An E2EE system notice is pushed to the chat, and the partner receives a push notification explaining the cancellation reason.

### 5. Admin Moderation & Auditing
- System administrators can access the **Admin Moderation Portal** to verify user identities, adjust trust scores, resolve disputes, and audit cancelled transactions to view cancellation reasons and comments.

## 6.3 Trust, Safety, and Layout Refactoring (Added in Post-Defense Phase)

To harden the platform and establish a highly secure ecosystem for peer-to-peer trades in Davao City, the following Trust & Safety systems were added:

1. **Double-Sided Verification PIN Handshake**: Protects offline meetup exchanges. Each transaction initializes two random 6-digit PIN codes (Buyer PIN and Seller PIN). During the physical meetup, the seller must input the buyer's PIN and the buyer must input the seller's PIN to complete the trade.
2. **Reputation Progression & Rewards**: Successful transactions validated by the double PIN handshake reward both buyer and seller with a permanent `+5` points to their `trustScore` (capped at 100).
3. **Hyperlocal Safety Safe Spot Suggestions**: During checkout, the app automatically determines the midpoint between the buyer's and seller's coordinates, runs a spatial geohash proximity query, and suggests safe meetup locations (parks, precincts, public hubs) near their midpoint.
4. **Disputes and Violations Reporting**: If a user exhibits bad conduct (e.g. meetup no-shows under Rule 303, listing inaccuracy under Rule 202, counterfeit/receipt forgery under Rule 404), the other party can file a formal dispute. This logs an active issue in the Firestore `disputes` collection.
5. **Impact & Barter Ledger**: Tracks ecological and financial benefits on user profiles:
   - *Money Saved (PHP)*: Calculates 100% of barter trade values and 40% of cash retail transaction values.
   - *Landfill Diversion (kg)*: Estimates 5kg of waste offset per transaction.
   - *CO2 Reduction (kg)*: Estimates 12kg of CO2 emissions saved per transaction.
6. **Trust Score Timeline**: Transparent vertical timeline logs each user's history of trust score changes, showing deltas (e.g. `+5` for trades, `-10` for chat flags, `-15` for upheld disputes) and specific rules applied.
7. **Role-Based Login Guidelines**: A selector on the login interface displays targeted notices outlining roles and codes of conduct for Buyers, Sellers, and general users before authenticating.
8. **Admin Moderation Portal Overhaul**: Expanded horizontal layout replacing collapsible sidebar navigation, featuring action dashboards for:
   - *Users Table*: Search, verify identity, and adjust trust scores with rule tags.
   - *Transactions log*: Audit and inspect verification codes, safe spots, and payments.
   - *Disputes Panel*: Audit reported cases, Dismiss, or Uphold disputes (applying automatic `-15` trust score penalty).

# 24. CHANGELOG & MAJOR UPDATES

| Date | Time | Update |
|---|---|---|
| June 20, 2026 | 12:11 AM | **Bug Fix — GoogleMap Blank Black Screen (Step 3 — Location & Publish)**: Fixed a runtime `TypeError: window.google.maps.Map is not a constructor` crash that rendered a blank black screen when advancing to the Location & Publish step in the listing wizard. Root cause: Google Identity Services (Sign-in SDK) initializes the global `window.google` object before the Google Maps API script finishes loading. The `GoogleMap.jsx` component was prematurely checking only `window.google` and calling `new window.google.maps.Map()` before `window.google.maps` was available. Fixed by strengthening all `useEffect` guards in `GoogleMap.jsx` to require both `window.google && window.google.maps` before proceeding. |
| June 20, 2026 | 12:11 AM | **Bug Fix — Firestore Notifications Index**: Identified a missing Firestore composite index on the `notifications` collection (composite on `userId ASC`, `createdAt DESC`) causing a `FirebaseError: The query requires an index` on the live deployment. The Firestore Console link to auto-create the index is included in the error log. |
| June 19, 2026 | 11:56 PM | **Documentation — Source Code Snippets Appendix (Appendix E)**: Created `SOURCE_CODE_SNIPPETS.md` documenting the exact implementation snippets for the 4 core algorithmic modules: CNN Classification (`mapRoboflowCategory` + `callRoboflowCategoryDetector`), OCR Extraction (Google Vision parallel label + text detection), Geohash Filtering (`encodeGeohash` + `getGeohashNeighbors`), and Facial Verification (`verifyIdentityUnified` Gemini multimodal pipeline). |
| June 19, 2026 | 11:39 PM | **Documentation — ISO/IEC 25010 Quality Evaluation & SUS Results**: Created `ISO_25010_EVALUATION.md` documenting the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality evaluation results (Grand Mean: 4.74/5.00 — Outstanding) across all 8 quality characteristics evaluated by 5 IT Experts and 30 End-Users, plus the System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 84.50/100 (Grade: A — Excellent). |
| June 19, 2026 | 11:29 PM | **Documentation — Functional Testing Appendix (Appendix D)**: Created `TESTING_DOCUMENTATION.md` covering 14 functional test cases (TC-001 to TC-014), real-time JSON execution logs for 8 core features (Registration, Image Upload, OCR, Listing Creation, Geohash Filtering, Chat, Facial Verification, Transaction Receipt), and the defect log (BUG-001 to BUG-003). |
| June 19, 2026 | 03:27 PM | **Documentation — Model Performance Appendix (Appendix C)**: Created `MODEL_PERFORMANCE.md` with full classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) per category, generated confusion matrix heatmap, precision-recall curves, and training history convergence chart. |
| June 19, 2026 | 02:30 PM | **AI Pipeline Upgrade — Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Migrated both the listing intelligence agent (`visionProcessor.js`) and the identity verification module (`faceVerification.js`) from legacy model references to `gemini-2.5-flash` with a model candidate fallback list (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-flash-latest`). Listing intelligence now generates structured JSON (title, category, subcategory, confidence_notes, foodExpiryDays, tags, suggestedPrice). Verification confidence threshold raised to ≥ 80%. |
| June 6, 2026 | 09:30 PM | **Codebase Cleanup and Hygiene Hardening**: Safely archived and deleted the unrelated `odysseus` sub-project directory and Docker config files (`Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.dev`, `docker-compose.yml`) from the repository root. Verified that the production build compiler (`npm run build`) works perfectly after cleanup. Updated documentation to reflect the clean and organized repository structure. |
| June 4, 2026 | 04:50 AM | **Administration, Security, and Git Optimization Overhaul**: Developed isolated system administrator layouts and sidebar navigation. Implemented `AdminRoute` protecting all administrative portal routes. Enhanced admin tables to show user active statuses, average ratings, a "Transactions" monitoring log, and live item/profile page previews. Added user reporting modals in chat that dynamically update user `trustScore` by -10 points. Refactored administrative credentials to load from environment variables (`.env.local`), removed/untracked `admin.json` from version control, untracked compiled `dist/` directory, and configured a dynamic local CLI provisioning script (`create-admin.cjs`). |
| June 1, 2026 | 02:40 PM | **Roboflow Category Detection Integration (Server-Side Migration)**: Migrated Roboflow Serverless Workflows API (`detect-and-classify`) to execute securely server-side inside Firebase Cloud Functions. Category confidence threshold set to ≥ 0.65. Mapped Roboflow predictions to the 10 KomuniTrade database category IDs via `mapRoboflowCategory`. Configured form resetting logic to clear all fields, tags, and GPS time marks on listing image deletion. |
| May 24, 2026 | 01:14 AM | **Post-Defense Hardening & Security Audit**: Migrated identity verification to server-side Cloud Function (`verifyUserIdentity`) using Google Gemini multimodal API. Seals all API key leak vectors by proxying Google Vision requests through server-side functions. Implements parallel 8-neighbor geohash scanning to eliminate border boundary discovery misses. Configures advanced Firestore and Storage security rules. Fixes E2EE multi-device key desync via `createUserProfile` key sync on auth state change. Adds chatId-derived decryption fallback and key rotation user messaging. |
| May 24, 2026 | 02:54 AM | **Documentation Audit**: Corrected all inaccurate README claims — replaced ArcFace/FaceNet with Gemini multimodal, MobileNetV3/PyTorch with Google Vision + Roboflow (server-side), removed unimplemented Dashboard Analytics and Feedback Forum from feature lists, removed Government ID Verification from delimitations (fully implemented), fixed `verifiedAt` Firestore field type from String to Timestamp. |
| May 17, 2026 | 06:29 PM | **Documentation**: Fully synchronized database schemas, E2EE message definitions, GCash receipt transactions, and 100% completion checklist milestones. |
| May 13, 2026 | 06:51 AM | **Feature**: Implemented Edit Listing feature, completing Sprint 5 backend CRUD operations. Added `EditItem.jsx` linked from Profile. |
| May 13, 2026 | 06:51 AM | **Settings**: Finalized Privacy & Security (Exact Location sharing) and Support & About settings sections. |
| May 13, 2026 | 06:45 AM | **Settings & DB Schema**: Synchronized user preferences (Phone, Trading Modes, Notification Preferences, Saved Spots) directly with Firestore `Users` collection. |
| May 13, 2026 | 06:45 AM | **Bug Fix**: Resolved critical race condition in Firebase Authentication across `Settings.jsx` and `Profile.jsx` using reactive `useAuth()` context. |
| May 13, 2026 | 06:45 AM | **Bug Fix**: Fixed fatal rendering crash in `ItemDetails.jsx` regarding missing listing price data. |
| May 12, 2026 | 11:30 PM | **Feature**: Implemented Location Filtering using Geohash to automatically sort and display items based on proximity. |

# 25. CODEBASE CLEAN CLEANUP AND DIRECTORY HYGIENE

To prevent codebase bloat and protect the repository from external code leakage, an extensive cleanup was executed to isolate and remove all non-KomuniTrade files from the workspace root.

## 25.1 Removed Directories & Configurations
The following resources were identified as unrelated or redundant and were safely removed from the repository root:
1. **`odysseus/` (Sub-project Directory)**: A separate Python repository consisting of service deployment configuration, macOS launch scripts, and unrelated service code. This folder has been fully untracked and removed.
2. **Docker Configuration Files (`Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.dev`, `docker-compose.yml`)**: Optional Docker setup configurations for the React application. These files have been removed to keep the local workspace clean for browser-native hosting.

# 26. KNOWN ISSUES & RESOLUTIONS

| ID | Issue | Status | Resolution |
|----|-------|--------|------------|
| BUG-001 | OCR fails on very dark/blurry images | **Fixed** | Added server-side `sharp` preprocessing (JPEG quality 80%, max 1024×1024) to normalize brightness before Vision API |
| BUG-002 | Chat messages duplicate on slow connection | **Fixed** | Implemented client-side message deduplication using transactional sequence IDs in state management |
| BUG-003 | Geohash boundary overlap (items on border not returned) | **Fixed** | Added secondary Haversine radial distance filter to exclude listings beyond the search radius |
| BUG-004 | Blank black screen on Step 3 (Location & Publish) | **Fixed** | `GoogleMap.jsx` prematurely detected `window.google` (set by Google Identity Services) before `window.google.maps` was loaded. Fixed by requiring `window.google && window.google.maps` in all `useEffect` guards |
| BUG-005 | Firestore index missing for notifications query | **Pending** | Composite index on `notifications` collection (`userId ASC`, `createdAt DESC`) must be created in Firebase Console using the auto-generated link in the browser console error |
